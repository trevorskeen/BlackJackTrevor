This is my blackJack game. I largely followed the requirements but I also chose to add some animations and implement a little known rule. Many casinos play by this rule but you don't see it too often. Its called the 5 card charlie rule (some casinos play 7). Its not a normal black jack rule but the idea is that if the player draws 5 cards and they are below 21 they win regardless of what the dealer draws.
